### Methods writeup - Resting state for Old Resting

Scans were collected on a 3.0 Tesla General Electric Signa® Excite™ scanner (Milwaukee, WI). Further details are provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1. Default mode ROIs (PCC and vmPFC) were 10 mm radius spheres centered at (0,−56,20) for PCC and (−2,48,−4) for vmPFC. These seed regions were adopted from previous studies of the DMN in PTSD (40, 45), schizophrenia (52), and healthy controls (17). Salience network ROIs (bilateral anterior insula) were partitioned from a whole insula mask using linear interpolation based on the location of the middle insular gyrus, following Aupperle and colleagues (53). We extracted spatially averaged time series from each ROI for each participant. Average BOLD time series from subject-specific structural MRI-derived white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks were added to the model as nuisance covariates to control for non-specific global sources of noise associated with BOLD fMRI scanning. We did not perform global-signal regression, as it had been suggested that this may produce spurious anti-correlation with orthogonal networks that increase in proportion to the size of the those networks (54). Resting state functional connectivity measures low-frequency spontaneous BOLD oscillations (.01 – .10 Hz band) (17), thus, the time-course for each voxel was band-passed filtered in this range. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between average time courses in the seed regions of interest (ROIs) and all other voxels of the brain resulting in a 3-dimensional correlation coefficient image (r-image). Both positive correlations and anti-correlations were computed. These r-images were then transformed to z-scores using a Fisher r-to-z transformation (55).
