Initializing spm8 Batch

Checking for warpfMRI.options ...not present.

 A command line command to drive batch processing to warp the fMRI time series
 to the standard template using normalization derived during the 'warpHiRes/vbm8HiRes' phase.


 The 'warpfMRI' command builds a script in the directory:

      matlabScripts/spm8Batch/warpfMRI/YYYY_MM directory

 directly below the current directory and will launch this script in
 background. The names of the matlab (if matlab based command) and shell 
 scripts will be in the format of :

          warpfMRI_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].m   and
          warpfMRI_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].sh

 where yymmdd is the date and HH_MM is the time.

 This script is expecting to find the necessary components in the
 directory scruture of :

     yymmddLF/                           (subject directory)
            anatomy/
            func/
               coReg/
               Physio/
               run_XX/

 Usage: 

     warpfMRI [OPTIONS] [subject_1] [subject_2] ... [subject_N]


 Options


   Number of allowed options : 15

   Key Parameter         Description
   --- ---------------   ----------------------------------------------------

    -B                   run in the foreground, need for daisy chaining jobs.

    -D                   enable super debug flag.

    -d                   enable debug flag.

    -f sub-directory     set relative path functional directory,
                         default=func

    -h HiResName         name of high resolution file, 
                         default is 'ht1spgr'

    -I ReferenceName     set the reference image to use for VBM8, 
                         you can specify relative to :
                            /nfs/psych-bhampstelab/VA_SPiRE_2015/fMRI_Working/MCore/SPM/SPM8/spm8_with_R6313/templates/, or.
                         specify an absolute directory path.
                         default is none, but to use defaults.normalise.write.bb

                         A reference image takes precedence over the voxel size.

    -l                   DO NOT use the sand box, even if possible.

    -M SUBJECTMASTER     set the directory to scan for subjects, 
                         default is Subjects/

    -n PrependName       name to add to output file name, 
                         default is none.

    -t                   enable testing flag, script will be built
                         but not run.

    -U user-email        set the user name for email notification, 
                         default is "tehsheng" of present shell.

    -v volume-wild       set the volume/Pfile/vbm8 name wild-card, 
                         default "raprun".

    -W                   Enable VBM8 warping for fMRI, you need to run vbm8HiRes first.
                         Default is to use standard SPM8 normalization.
                         This will set the output name to from 'w' to 'vbm8_' if you have not already
                         specified '-n' to change the prepend name.

    -w sub-directory     set registration path (for coreg, warp, tarBET etc)
                         default=coReg/

                         This flag has many uses:

                         coregOverlay  : directory to run the registration of 't1overlay'
                         coregHiRes    : directory to run the registation of 't1spgr'
                         warpHiRes     : directory to run the warping of HiRes ('t1spgr')
                         vbm8HiRes     : directory to place the VBM8 produced files
                         newSeg        : directory to place the New Segment produced files
                         warpfMRI      : location to find the warping instructions
                         pcafMRI       : location to find WM and CSF masks, typically 
                                         the directory from vbm8HiRes or newSeg
    -z VOXELSIZE/MATRIX  set the voxel size for resampling, or 
                         reconstruction size (used in 'reconSpiral').
                         default is spm default for voxel-size or 0 for recon matrix
                         See '-I' flag for overriding this for 'vbm8HiRes' and 'warpfMRI'.

 e.g. 

   To warp fmri using the 'het1spgr':

     warpfMRI -w func/MSIT 050126zz


*NOTE:  This code will actually hunt out rapruns's (or those specified in the -v flag
        The code does not actually care where the files live and will attempt to warp 
        any and all volumes using the specified SPGR (or default) volume. However you
        can narrow the search by supplying the '-s subdir' option which will then require
        that 'subdir' is a string contained in the list of directories returned for warping.
        If this DOES NOT make sense to you please contact Robert before proceeding.
