Initializing spm8 Batch

Checking for vbm8HiRes.options ...not present.

 A command line command to drive batch processing to VBM8 the 'HIRES' image.


 The 'vbm8HiRes' command builds a script in the directory:

      matlabScripts/spm8Batch/vbm8HiRes/YYYY_MM directory

 directly below the current directory and will launch this script in
 background. The names of the matlab (if matlab based command) and shell 
 scripts will be in the format of :

          vbm8HiRes_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].m   and
          vbm8HiRes_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].sh

 where yymmdd is the date and HH_MM is the time.

 This script is expecting to find the necessary components in the
 directory scruture of :

     yymmddLF/                           (subject directory)
            anatomy/
            func/
               coReg/
               Physio/
               run_XX/

 Usage: 

     vbm8HiRes [OPTIONS] [subject_1] [subject_2] ... [subject_N]


 Options


   Number of allowed options : 17

   Key Parameter         Description
   --- ---------------   ----------------------------------------------------

    -a sub-directory     set relative path for anatomy directory,
                         default=anatomy

    -B                   run in the foreground, need for daisy chaining jobs.

    -D                   enable super debug flag.

    -d                   enable debug flag.

    -E [WME CSFE]        set the erosion iteration numbers for
                         the white matter and csf respectively.
                         YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY TWO NUMBERS!

    -H                   calculate bias field corrected image in vbm8 only.
                         default is off.

    -h HiResName         name of high resolution file, 
                         default is 'ht1spgr'

    -I ReferenceName     set the reference image to use for VBM8, 
                         you can specify relative to :
                            /nfs/psych-bhampstelab/VA_SPiRE_2015/fMRI_Working/MCore/SPM/SPM8/spm8_with_R6313/templates/, or.
                         specify an absolute directory path.
                         default is none, but to use defaults.normalise.write.bb

                         A reference image takes precedence over the voxel size.

    -L                   Erosion flag.
                         Instructs vbm8HiRes to do the erosion before resampling.
                         Default is to erode after resampling.

    -M SUBJECTMASTER     set the directory to scan for subjects, 
                         default is Subjects/

    -m "[fsl options]"   Give options to mcflirt or slicetimer or fslmaths.

                         Be sure to specify inside of quotes.

                         do "mcflirt --help" for help.
                         do "slicetimer --help" for help.
                         do "fslmaths --help" for help.
                         default for realignfMRI is "-cost normcorr -stats -plots"
                         default for sliceTime is ""
                         default for erodeMask is "-s 5 -sub 0.333"

    -n PrependName       name to add to output file name, 
                         default is none.

    -O OtherName         coregOverlay/HiRes : name of other file to process,
                         you can specify relative path or absolute path,
                         the path can also have generic with subject name
                         substitute wherever [S] is in filename/path.
                         If relative path, then assume to look in the
                         anatomy [or coReg for warpHiRes] directory.
                         default is none.
    -t                   enable testing flag, script will be built
                         but not run.

    -U user-email        set the user name for email notification, 
                         default is "tehsheng" of present shell.

    -w sub-directory     set registration path (for coreg, warp, tarBET etc)
                         default=anatomy/vbm8/

                         This flag has many uses:

                         coregOverlay  : directory to run the registration of 't1overlay'
                         coregHiRes    : directory to run the registation of 't1spgr'
                         warpHiRes     : directory to run the warping of HiRes ('t1spgr')
                         vbm8HiRes     : directory to place the VBM8 produced files
                         newSeg        : directory to place the New Segment produced files
                         warpfMRI      : location to find the warping instructions
                         pcafMRI       : location to find WM and CSF masks, typically 
                                         the directory from vbm8HiRes or newSeg
    -z VOXELSIZE/MATRIX  set the voxel size for resampling, or 
                         reconstruction size (used in 'reconSpiral').
                         default is spm default for voxel-size or 0 for recon matrix
                         See '-I' flag for overriding this for 'vbm8HiRes' and 'warpfMRI'.


 e.g. 

   To process the image 'ht1spgr.nii' through VBM8 to create MNI space
   image do:

     vbm8HiRes 050126zz

 This command can be used with two different strategies:

 1) calculate normalization of a hi-resoluton image for further VBM processing.

    In this case (the default mode), the code will look for the high resolution image
    in the 'anatomy/' directory.

       e.g. vbm8HiRes 050126zz

 2) calculation normalization of a coregistered hi-resolution image for warping of functionals.

   In this case, you will need to use the '-a' flag to point to the anatomy.
   Additionally, you will need to use the '-w' flag to indicate where to write the
   results.

      e.g. vbm8HiRes 050126zz -a func/coReg -w func/coReg/VBM8

 EXPERTS ONLY:

     You can override options by specifying a file vbm8HiRes.options in the directory
     where you issue this command. This file is a matlab template to override default
     options in the code. Use at your own risk!

     See MethodsCore/spm8Batch/Help/Options/ for templates

 Current command default configuration is:

 anatomy path             : anatomy/
 name of hisres image     : ht1spgr

 all(1) or biasfield(0)   : 1
 prepending name          : vbm8_

 functional images path    : ./
 Subject directory         : Subjects/

 Back(1)/fore(0)ground     : 1
