Initializing spm8 Batch

Checking for coregOverlay.options ...not present.

 A command line command to drive batch processing to coregister the 'overlay'
 to fmri analyze image.


 The 'coregOverlay' command builds a script in the directory:

      matlabScripts/spm8Batch/coregOverlay/YYYY_MM directory

 directly below the current directory and will launch this script in
 background. The names of the matlab (if matlab based command) and shell 
 scripts will be in the format of :

          coregOverlay_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].m   and
          coregOverlay_yymmdd_HH_MM_[USER]_[COMPUTER].sh

 where yymmdd is the date and HH_MM is the time.

 This script is expecting to find the necessary components in the
 directory scruture of :

     yymmddLF/                           (subject directory)
            anatomy/
            func/
               coReg/
               Physio/
               run_XX/

 Usage: 

     coregOverlay [OPTIONS] [subject_1] [subject_2] ... [subject_N]


 Options


   Number of allowed options : 15

   Key Parameter         Description
   --- ---------------   ----------------------------------------------------

    -a sub-directory     set relative path for anatomy directory,
                         default=anatomy

    -B                   run in the foreground, need for daisy chaining jobs.

    -D                   enable super debug flag.

    -d                   enable debug flag.

    -f sub-directory     set relative path functional directory,
                         default=func

    -M SUBJECTMASTER     set the directory to scan for subjects, 
                         default is Subjects/

    -n PrependName       name to add to output file name, 
                         default is none.

    -O OtherName         coregOverlay/HiRes : name of other file to process,
                         you can specify relative path or absolute path,
                         the path can also have generic with subject name
                         substitute wherever [S] is in filename/path.
                         If relative path, then assume to look in the
                         anatomy [or coReg for warpHiRes] directory.
                         default is none.
    -o OverlayName       name of overlay file, 
                         default is 'eht1overlay'

    -r                   set reslice flag to 1, reslice also
                         default 0, mutually exclusive with '-R'

    -s SUB-DIRECTORY     set sub-directory name under 'run_XX', 
                         default is none.

    -t                   enable testing flag, script will be built
                         but not run.

    -U user-email        set the user name for email notification, 
                         default is "tehsheng" of present shell.

    -v volume-wild       set the volume/Pfile/vbm8 name wild-card, 
                         default "raprun".

    -w sub-directory     set registration path (for coreg, warp, tarBET etc)
                         default=coReg/

                         This flag has many uses:

                         coregOverlay  : directory to run the registration of 't1overlay'
                         coregHiRes    : directory to run the registation of 't1spgr'
                         warpHiRes     : directory to run the warping of HiRes ('t1spgr')
                         vbm8HiRes     : directory to place the VBM8 produced files
                         newSeg        : directory to place the New Segment produced files
                         warpfMRI      : location to find the warping instructions
                         pcafMRI       : location to find WM and CSF masks, typically 
                                         the directory from vbm8HiRes or newSeg


 e.g. 

   To coregister the 'het1overlay.img' to the first 'raprun' found in
   the first 'run' (e.g. run_1, or run_01) of the experiment. 
   The run directory is expected to live in the 'func/' directory.

     coregOverlay -f func/MSIT 050126zz

   or optionaly look for the first avol image in the func/MSIT/run_01/ra_img

     coregOverlay -w coReg8 -f func/MSIT -v arun -s ra_img 050126zz


 Current command default configuration is:

 anatomy path             : anatomy/
 directory to coreg       : func//coReg//
 functional sub-dir       : 
 functional images        : raprun
 name of overlay image    : ht1overlay
 reslice option           : 0
 prepending name          : 
 Other images             : 0


 functional images path    : func/
 Subject directory         : Subjects/

 Back(1)/fore(0)ground     : 1
